// iFrames

// Basically a page embedded in your parent page
// These aren't common in new apps, but we still need to know how to deal with them.

// By default, the browser won't have access to this frame
// The context of this part of the page is inside the frame.

// To access this frame, you need to switch your context from the original page to the frame page.
// Similarly, when you're inside this frame, you won't have access to the parent page (you would need to switch context again)

// It's like another child window/tab, but it's just embedded in the page.
