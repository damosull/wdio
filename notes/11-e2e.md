In reference to 15-e2e-test-p1.js:

// We're going to specify clicking the 'Add' button for some products:

// 1. Log in
// 2. Loop through all products & get the link text values
// 3. During the loop, if the text is in our list, click the Add button

In reference to 16-e2e-test-p2.js:

// Here, we'll focus on gathering the sum of the individual items in the cart.
// We'll skip over the first 3 steps below as they are explained in the previous spec file
// We're going to show you 2 ways to approach this. The 1st uses less code, but is a bit more complex. The 2nd approach uses for loops

Todo: merge the above notes & the remaining notes in the 15 & 16 spec files so they make sense & can be used alongside each other.

Also, we'll move the e2e tests into a e2e folder under rahul.
See if we can merge the 2 spec files, or if they need to be kept seperate
