- For JS Alerts, you can't inspect them because they don't have any HTML behind them. Therefore, we have to use the following:
  - .isAlertOpen() - checks if the alert is open
  - .getAlertText() - gets the text within the alert
  - .acceptAlert() - accepts & closes the alert pop-up

see 09_JS_alerts.js for examples
