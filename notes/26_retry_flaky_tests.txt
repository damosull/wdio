--- Adding Retries for flaky tests  ---

NB Note *****************:
  I followed the notes, but wasn't 100% sure it worked, & wasn't able to find a working example online

WDIO Documentation: https://webdriver.io/docs/retry/

Flaky test = inconsistent results

For these kinds of tests, we can add retries if there's a high chance the test will pass the next time.

All you need to do is add `this.retries(4)` to your code.

If you add this within a `describe()` block, all tests in the suite are retried up to 4 times.
If you add this within an `it()` block, only that test will be retried up to 4 times.

Note: If you want to use retries, you need to use an unbound function [function(){}] instead of fat arrow [() => {}]. The reasoning is in the Mocha docs, but won't go into it here, we just need to know that you need to do it.

Look in the logs to see that it's being run multiple times
If the test failed for all retries, you should see Expected vs Received values for the number of times you re-ran the test.
If the test passed the 2nd time, you should only see that it ran twice
