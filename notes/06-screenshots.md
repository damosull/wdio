- `screenshot.png` in the project root is created by the test in `07_checkboxes_screenshots.js`
  You can programatically take screenshots like we have done in this test
- `browser.saveScreenshot('screenshot.png')` adds the screenshot to the root of your project by default. You can specify a different path if required.
