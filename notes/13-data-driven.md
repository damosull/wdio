// Data Driven - Parameterise test cases using Mocha Framework & JSON files

// Here, we're going to parameterise test cases with different sets of data.
// And how we can drive data from JSON files

// For this, we're going to test the Invalid Login scenario with different data sets
// We're going to run this test case for different combinations of login credentials
// For example, you could use it for blank values, different types of invalid passwords, etc.

// Data Driven - Parameterise test cases using Mocha Framework & JSON files - Part 2

// Here, we're going to see how to deal with nested arrays.
// We're going to create a JSON file that contains different combinations of product names.
// Then based on the JSON array, we'll loop through the test case & use the products in the JSON to populate our tests
